# Assignment - 2

1. Create a npm project and install Express.js (Nodemon if you want)
2. Create an Express.js app which funnels the requests through 2 middleware functions that log something to the console and return one response.
3. Handle requests to "/" and "/users" such that each request only has one handler/middleware that does something with it (e.g. send dummy response).
